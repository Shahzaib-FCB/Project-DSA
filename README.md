## Description
Forward indexes words from a wikipedia .xml dump file and serializes the entries after pre-processing the data and then in the end allows the user to search the dump files in real time.


[indexTime.txt](https://github.com/ShahzaibWaseem/Project-DSA/blob/master/indexTime.txt) is a log file which records how much time it took for indexing a particular .xml file.


[searchTime.txt](https://github.com/ShahzaibWaseem/Project-DSA/blob/master/searchTime.txt) is a log file which records what word was searched and how much time it took to return the results and it is pretty evident that it took less than a fraction of second which asserts the claim that it forward indexes the content of the .xml file and then searches for it.
